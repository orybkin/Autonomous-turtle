Fun
	show differential image
	launch face recognition, if it can see any (they may be to high)
	run tracker, maybe denis' one
	робот двигается к цели в кажущейся случайной манере, виляет, или двигается зигзагом

Maybe to PID and dijskstra instead

Deep magic
    Maybe discard map once a while
    Or keep variances. If they don't give it, apprixmate by distance at the moment of shooting

    Intead of odometry
        using ICP is almost hopeless. We need 0.25 sec to extract points.
            Trimmed ICP may work
            crazy hack with hand cropping
            Rotation averaging?
            loop closing?
        using markers as anchors?
        fusion?

    sparsify the map somehow (on your phone should be a paper about it).
        maybe ransac them all with planes and remember planes?

    use threads? in general, what about structure?

Not fun
    dont reset odometry. when you do it there is a (100%) chance it will be reseted after next sample will be taken
    markers sometimes occur with id 0, should be filtered out
    the coordinate system isn't perfectly upright. also, kinect isn't perfectly upright
    одометрия работает из калибрации двигателей.

current motion execution precision is up to 10 degrees per meter, but usually is mild, more like 2.5 degrees.
robot moves 0.13-0.15 rad / 21 - 25 cm per cycle at 0.5 velocities. First step is a bit (~5%) smaller.
robot moves approximately on frequency 2 hertz. normal deviation is 0.5 degree per meter and 1 cm per 90 degrees.
    First step deviation is bigger
topics are updated with roughly the same frequency 10 fps

can I install packages on turtles?
can they add obstacles during the course of testing?
