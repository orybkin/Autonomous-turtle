Current:
    speed up the robot


    sometimes the path is planned completely of the field to nothing
    hacks and tunes.
     Tune RRT: obstacles treshold and search dimensions. Save a map once and inspect how to filter obstacles
     If we are close to a marker, beep

    registration is too slow. threads needed
    markers are still noisy
    dijsktra if have time


Possible improvements:
    Camera stuff in marker estimation
    PID regulation of anglular velocity
    Dijsktra. A*
    Variance saving in mapping
    Anomaly detection in mapping. With ICP/SLAM.
    RANSAC in checkpoint estimation
    change goals generation in path_contr so that rot are also goals


The Pipeline:
    Marker 3d estimation - camera geometry or heuristics (see forum post)
    Checkpoint 3d estimation - fitting the plane (with SVD or RANSAC)
    Creating the bird view
    Environment mapping with odometry or ICP
    Global path planning with tree search or RRT
    Local path planning with PID or heuristics

As an alternative, if we don't fix movement, global planning can be redone each time we get to the current goal.
